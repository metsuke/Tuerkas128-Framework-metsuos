# Tuerkas128 Framework

Tuerkas128 Framework is a set of Z80 assembler libraries to develop games for the ZX Spectrum 128k. You can use it:
* for study purposes
* to make mods of the orginal games
* to make add-ons and produce your own framework
* to develop your own games
* to let your imagination run wild

Tutorials are available at https://www.youtube.com/@RetroBensoft (only in spanish, sorry)

Instead of publishing the framework raw code, the complete code of the games developed by RetroBensoft with Tukeras128 Framework is shared here. By doing so, it is much easier to understand the code because a real example is provided.

Available games:
* Perseus (2025)  

###Requirements
* Windows 10/11(I'm pretty sure a Lixux version is easy to implement)
* pasmo.exe and gentape.exe folders must be in Windows PATH variable
